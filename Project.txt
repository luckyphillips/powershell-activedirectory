Real world scenario if you wanted to try something different:
(i) Connect to a SQL server storing badge swipe in timestamps

(ii) Grab FirstName, LastName, BadgeSwipeInTime since the last time we ran

(iii) Connect to Active Directory AD

(iv) Find the User's email address and last logon timestamp in AD that corresponds to the SQL server FirstName/LastName/BadgeSwipeInTime from step ii

(v) Send email to user with their last login, from AD, and last badge swipe in time, from SQL server.
Schedule the above job daily.

Bonus: Scale the above situation to 100xthousand users in AD and in the SQL server DB. You will be amazed at how the different data structures in powershell affect performance.
We cover AD more tomorrow.
